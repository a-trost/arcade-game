Dogger - Arcade Game
===============================

Navigate Dogger through levels of unfriendly animals, dangerous cars, and maybe more! Collect hotdogs to increase your score and make Dogger happy.

## How to Play
Arrow Keys or WASD will move you around the board. Take a second to orient yourself with what direction "up" is, as the isometric board does not have true Up, Down, Left, or Right.

Avoid any kind of moving character, like rams, sloths, foxes, etc. Collect hotdogs. You can't pass through barriers like rocks. 

Get across the board to go to the next level.
