## How to Play
[Click to play Dogger.](https://a-trost.github.io/dogger/)
Arrow Keys or WASD will move you around the board. Take a second to orient yourself with what direction "up" is, as the isometric board does not have true Up, Down, Left, or Right.

Avoid any kind of moving character, like rams, sloths, foxes, etc. Collect hotdogs. You can't pass through barriers like rocks. 

Get across the board to go to the next level.
