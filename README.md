Dogger - Arcade Game
===============================

Navigate Dogger through levels of unfriendly animals, dangerous cars, and maybe more! Collect hotdogs to increase your score and make Dogger happy.

## How to Play
[Click to play Dogger.](https://a-trost.github.io/dogger/)
Arrow Keys or WASD will move you around the board. Take a second to orient yourself with what direction "up" is, as the isometric board does not have true Up, Down, Left, or Right.

Avoid any kind of moving character like cats, roombas, hamsters, rams, foxes, etc. Collect hotdogs for points. You can't pass through barriers like TVs, chairs and rocks. 

Get across the board to go to the next level. Pass enough levels and go to the next world. 

## What is This?
Why would anyone make such a game? Why would anyone go through all the trouble to make a game that is only mildly fun to play?

This was part of an assignment for a Frontend Developer course with Udacity. I didn't love the art it came with, so I grabbed assets from [Google Poly](https://poly.google.com/), rendered them in photoshop, made some floor textures, and made features until it felt done. Dogger is the result.
