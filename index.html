    <h1>Dogger</h1> 
    <h3>Directions</h3>  
    <p>
    Arrow Keys or WASD will move you around the board. Take a second to orient yourself with what direction "up" is, as the isometric board does not have true Up, Down, Left, or Right.        
    </p>
    <p>
Avoid any kind of moving character, like rams, sloths, foxes, etc. Collect hotdogs. You can't pass through barriers like rocks.
</p>
<p>Get across the board to go to the next level.</p>
